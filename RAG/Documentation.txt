Code Summary For Retrieval Augmented Generative System

PDF Reader
fitz was used as the file reader

Text and Sentence Splitting
Lang chain was used for the text splitting
llama was used for the sentence splitting

Chunks Customization
Each chunk was made to be composed of 500 characters

Embedding
The embedding model used was "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"

Vector Database
Qdrant was used as the vector database to store the embedded chunks
it was hosted locally using docker at port 6333
challenges were met in trying to user a different local port so the default port 6333 was used in the end

Retrival
teh code uses the top five chunks it comes accros in its search to generate the response

Response Generation
The generation for the response wa smenat to be streamed but came accross issues with authentication of the api key being used which was sourced from openAI
this issue was resolved by using the "litellm._turn_on_debug()" as recommended by the error mesages that popped up upon running the cell containing the response code
